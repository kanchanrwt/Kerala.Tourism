      <h1>JUDAISM IN KERALA</h1>
      <p class="p2">The history of the first Jewish diaspora in Kerala or
        Kerala’s exposure to Judaism or, to put it
        even more
        differently, the story of the granting of asylum to the Jews in Kerala
        is a long and interesting one. It is
        not always supported by authentic records and, precisely for that
        reason, speculations abound about the exact
        time of the arrival of the Jews on the western shores of the
        southernmost part of India. According to some
        historians, the first Jews to reach Kerala were traders. They came
        during the time of King Solomon, that is,
        more than 2,000 years back.</p>

        ruffling its liquid meniscus. Eco-Tourism is
